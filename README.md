# Games Project

# What is this project?
This project was assigned to us during our first year studies in Metropolia University of applied sciences. The aim was to develop a working 2D adventure game which included a storyline, using C# programming language and unity as a game development platform.

# How can you get started with this project?

The first step is to download Unity from https://goo.gl/1rrETC. This is a personal and free version of Unity. One can also download the plus or pro versions from https://unity3d.com/unity. During the download process one can decide to use Visual Studio or MonoDevelop. Visual Studio is heavier software compared to MonoDevelop, however they both support C# programming language. This project uses MonoDevelop.

In order to play the game one will need unity to build the game using unity build settings. This link ( https://ibb.co/bPBGOSto) shows how to build the game. This will create application (.exe file) in our local computer. Now, open it and play! Enjoy!

# Where can you get help and how can you help?

If you need help, leave you comment and we will get back to you as soon as possible. This is a school project; unfortunately outside help is not possible at the moment. In the future collaboration may be possible.

# Who maintain and contributes to the project?

At the moment a team of three students who maintain and contributes to the project. The names of the team members are Alex, Phat and Zerihun.
