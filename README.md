# What is this project?

This project was assigned to us during our first year studies in Metropolia University of applied sciences.
The aim was to develop a working 2D advanture game which included a storyline, using C# programming language and unity as a game delopment platform.

# What does the project do?....

# How can you get started with this project?

The first step is to download Unity from https://goo.gl/1rrETC. This is a personal and free version of Unity. One can also download the plus or pro versions from https://unity3d.com/unity. During the download process one can decide to use Visual Studio or MonoDevlop. Visual Studio is a heavier software compared to MonoDevlop, however they both support C# programming language. This project uses MonoDelop.

In order to play the game one will need unity to bulid the game using unity bulid settings. This link( https://ibb.co/bPBGOSto) shows how to bulid the game. This will creat application (.exe file) in our local computer. Now, open it and play! enjoy!
